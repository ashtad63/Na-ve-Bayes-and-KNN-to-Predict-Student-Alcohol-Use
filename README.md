# Naive Bayes and KNN to Predict a Student's Alcohol Use

The Alcohol Use Data Set is an interesting dataset because it contains much social data.  The variables are all \
discrete – both regular categorical and interval.  We are going to use these data to predict a student’s alcohol \
use based on the values of these various features.  We will be using the KNN and Naïve Bayes algorithms for this \
analysis.

There is a bit of preprocessing necessary to use this dataset.  Each of the category variables need to be \
transformed. It would be good to use pivot tables and histograms to see how the features are distributed \
among the two classes.
